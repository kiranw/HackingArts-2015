# HackingArts-2015
hackathon project at MIT's Hacking Arts 2015

Though I'm a CS major, I have a strong interest in art and also am pursuing an Architecture minor - I found a pattern in most of my art-discussion-based classes. It took a while to become comfortable with the language, but once I got all the lingo down it became a lot easier. This site is inspired by my personal struggles to "understand" the art.
